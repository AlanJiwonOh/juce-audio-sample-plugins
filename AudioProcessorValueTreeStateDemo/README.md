AudioProcessorValueTreeStateDemo
================================
Based on mda's open-sourced algorithms. this is the Degrade (Lo-Fi plug-in...) for checking the newer parameters mechanism included since JUCE 4.x.
<br />
I'll try to keep this project update since there aren't yet much demos for its usage.

Fell free to suggest patches/fixes/ideas.
I've yet to test it on Windows machine but it should also be built for Windows once you setup VST/RTAS/AAX.
